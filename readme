Project Title: Artisan Irrigation Website

Author: Francis McCleneghen

Description:
  This is an application for my father's company Artisan Irrigation. It was created for my course CIS480 at ECPI University.
  The purpose of this application is to serve as a website for the company and an alternative method of submitting and receiving maintenance request tickets.
  We hope this application will reduce incoming phone traffic and provide a convenient way for customers to request maintenance on their irrigation systems.

Built with:
  Languages: PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS
  Xampp - Apache webserver distribution that contains MariaDB, PHP, and Perl.
  phpMyAdmin - An administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB

Requirements:
  A database is set up using phpMyAdmin using the provided ".sql" file.

Usage Instructions:
  Users can navigate throughout the website using the top navigation bar. 
  Users can log in at three "user levels": Admin, Technician, or User. Admins can view the database connection status. Technicians have access to the maintenance ticket management form. Users have access to the Account page and maintenance ticket request form.
